------------------------------------------------------------

1. URL Shortening Service
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you ensure that each long URL gets a unique short URL?
A:
    - I would use an auto-incrementing counter to generate a unique integer for every new long URL.
    - This unique integer is then encoded to a Base62 string (using digits, lowercase and uppercase letters).
    - This approach guarantees uniqueness and generates a short, compact alias.
    
Q: Why would you choose a counter with Base62 encoding over hashing the URL?
A:
    - A counter with Base62 encoding is deterministic and collision‑free, whereas hashing might lead to collisions.
    - The counter method is simple, efficient, and produces short codes consistently.
    
Q: How would you scale this service if thousands of URL shortening requests come in per second?
A:
    - Scale the API horizontally behind a load balancer.
    - Use a distributed counter or partition the URL mappings across multiple nodes (e.g., by short code prefix).
    - Employ caching (like Redis) to speed up redirects.
    
Q: How do you handle persistent storage of URL mappings? What if the in‑memory dictionary fails?
A:
    - In production, I’d use a persistent key‑value store (e.g., Redis, Cassandra, or MySQL) instead of an in‑memory dictionary.
    - This ensures durability, replication, and fault tolerance.
    
Q: How would you support custom short URLs?
A:
    - I’d add an option for users to supply a custom alias.
    - The system would check for availability before storing it.
    
Q: How do you track click statistics, and how would you delete expired URLs?
A:
    - Log each redirection event in a separate analytics store, or increment a counter in the URL mapping.
    - Use TTL (time-to-live) for mappings and a background job to remove expired URLs.
    
Q: What API endpoints would you expose?
A:
    - A POST endpoint for creating a short URL.
    - A GET endpoint for redirection (retrieving the long URL from the short code).
    
Q: How would you use a load balancer in front of this service?
A:
    - The load balancer would distribute incoming API requests among multiple URL shortener instances,
      ensuring even load and high availability.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Video Streaming Service (YouTube/Netflix)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you handle video uploads and transcoding to support multiple resolutions?
A:
    - Use an upload API that accepts large files (with chunking/resumable uploads).
    - Once uploaded, dispatch the video to a transcoding pipeline that converts it into various resolutions and formats.
    
Q: What is your approach to storing and delivering petabytes of video data?
A:
    - Store video files in a distributed object storage system (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    - Use a CDN to cache and deliver video segments to users, reducing latency.
    
Q: How do you integrate a CDN to reduce latency?
A:
    - The streaming server generates signed URLs for video segments.
    - The CDN caches these segments and serves them to users based on geographic proximity.
    
Q: How would you partition your metadata database for billions of videos?
A:
    - Partition by video ID ranges or by geographic region.
    - Use sharding to distribute load across multiple database servers.
    
Q: How would you record view counts, likes, and comments in real time?
A:
    - Log events via a message queue (like Kafka) and update counters asynchronously.
    - Use caching and eventual consistency for high-frequency metrics.
    
Q: How do you support real-time comments while ensuring low latency in streaming?
A:
    - Implement a separate comment service that uses WebSockets or long polling to deliver updates instantly.
    - Store comments in a database optimized for fast writes and reads (e.g., NoSQL).

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Global Chat Service (Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How would you implement real-time messaging between users?
A:
    - Use WebSockets for persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication.
    - Maintain an active connection for each user and push messages to them in real time.
    
Q: What protocol would you use and why?
A:
    - I would use WebSockets because they provide real-time communication without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests.
    
Q: How do you ensure that messages are delivered reliably even if a user is offline?
A:
    - Persist messages in a database so that if a user is offline, messages are stored for later retrieval.
    - Use push notifications to alert the user when new messages are available.
    
Q: How would you store chat history and support group chats?
A:
    - Store messages in a distributed database with partitioning by chat or conversation.
    - For group chats, use a fan‑out mechanism to efficiently deliver messages to multiple recipients.
    
Q: How do you scale the system to handle millions of concurrent connections?
A:
    - Use an event-driven architecture with non-blocking I/O (e.g., Node.js or Python’s asyncio).
    - Scale chat servers horizontally behind a load balancer.
    
Q: What strategies would you use to handle message fan-out in group chats?
A:
    - Implement a pub/sub system to broadcast messages to all members in a group.
    
Q: How would you design end‑to‑end encryption for messages?
A:
    - Use client‑side encryption where encryption/decryption happens on the client,
      and the server only relays encrypted messages.
    
Q: How do you implement push notifications for offline users?
A:
    - Integrate with mobile push notification services (APNs, FCM) to notify users when messages arrive.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Social Network / Message Board (Quora/Reddit/HackerNews)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How would you store posts, comments, and votes, and how do you generate a personalized news feed?
A:
    - Use a relational or NoSQL database to store posts, comments, and votes.
    - Generate feeds by aggregating posts from users/topics a person follows,
      possibly precomputing feeds (push model) or querying on demand (pull model).
    
Q: Would you use a push or pull model for feed generation, and why?
A:
    - For high read traffic, a push model (fan‑out on write) is often preferred for faster feed retrieval.
      However, for users following millions of sources, a pull model may be necessary.
    
Q: How would you partition user and post data to support billions of users?
A:
    - Partition data by user ID ranges or geographic regions.
    - Use sharding and replication to distribute load.
    
Q: What caching strategies would you employ to handle heavy read traffic?
A:
    - Use in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed feeds and post content.
    
Q: How do you handle user follows, upvotes/downvotes, and comment threads?
A:
    - Store follow relationships in a dedicated graph or relational table.
    - Keep votes as counters associated with posts.
    - Store comments with a parent reference to support threaded discussions.
    
Q: How would you integrate moderation or spam prevention mechanisms?
A:
    - Implement filtering algorithms, user reporting, and possibly machine learning models to flag inappropriate content.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Search Typeahead (Autocomplete)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Which data structure would you use to store previous search queries for fast prefix lookups?
A:
    - I would use a Trie (prefix tree) for fast, O(m) lookup based on the length of the prefix,
      or a sorted list with binary search for simplicity.
    
Q: What are the trade-offs between using a Trie and a sorted list with binary search?
A:
    - A Trie offers fast lookups but can be memory‑intensive.
      A sorted list with binary search is simpler and more memory‑efficient but may be slower for very large datasets.
    
Q: How do you ensure that the autocomplete results are updated with trending queries in real time?
A:
    - Use a dynamic frequency count to rank queries and update the Trie or sorted list periodically.
    
Q: How would you handle a high volume of queries per second while keeping latency low?
A:
    - Keep the data in memory and replicate the service horizontally behind a load balancer.
    
Q: How would you partition or replicate the data to support millions of queries?
A:
    - Partition by locale or first letter if the dataset is too large, and replicate the service across multiple nodes.
    
Q: How would you rank the suggestions (e.g., frequency, recency, personalization)?
A:
    - I’d combine factors like frequency of search, recency of queries, and possibly user-specific data to rank suggestions.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. Global File Storage & Sharing Service (Dropbox/Google Drive/Google Photos)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How would you handle large file uploads (e.g., chunking and resumable uploads)?
A:
    - Break large files into chunks and support resumable uploads so that only failed chunks need to be retried.
    
Q: What mechanisms would you use to allow seamless file downloads and synchronization across devices?
A:
    - Use a REST API to serve file metadata and generate signed URLs for file downloads.
      Clients sync with the server for changes; local file watchers (on desktop/mobile) detect updates.
    
Q: How would you store file metadata and actual file contents?
A:
    - Use a relational database for file metadata (directories, permissions, versions) and a distributed
      object storage system (like AWS S3) for actual file content.
    
Q: How do you ensure ACID properties for file operations, especially in a distributed environment?
A:
    - Use transactions in the metadata database and ensure the file storage system provides redundancy and consistency.
    
Q: How would you scale storage for potentially petabytes of data?
A:
    - Use cloud storage solutions or a distributed file system with replication and partitioning.
    
Q: How would you handle file sharing permissions and concurrent edits by multiple users?
A:
    - Implement an access control list (ACL) for file sharing and use versioning or locking mechanisms to manage concurrent edits.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Web Crawler
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you ensure that your crawler does not fetch the same page twice?
A:
    - Maintain a deduplication store (e.g., a hash set or Bloom filter) to track visited URLs.
    
Q: What data structures would you use for deduplication?
A:
    - A hash set provides O(1) lookup. For a massive scale, a Bloom filter is memory‑efficient, though it has a small false-positive rate.
    
Q: How would you ensure that your crawler is polite and doesn’t overload any single domain?
A:
    - Implement a scheduling system that enforces crawl delays per domain, often by maintaining a timestamp of the last fetch per domain.
    
Q: How would you implement a scheduling system to respect crawl delays from robots.txt?
A:
    - Fetch and parse robots.txt for each domain to determine crawl delay settings,
      then use a priority queue or separate per-domain queues to schedule URLs.
    
Q: How would you scale your crawler to fetch billions of pages?
A:
    - Distribute crawling tasks across multiple machines, partition the URL frontier by domain or hash,
      and use asynchronous I/O to handle thousands of concurrent network requests.
    
Q: What mechanisms would you use for distributed crawling and coordination?
A:
    - Use a distributed work queue (e.g., Apache Kafka) to assign URLs to crawler workers,
      and persist state so that work can be resumed after failures.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. Social Media Service (Facebook/Twitter/Instagram)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do users post content, and how is that content stored?
A:
    - Content is stored in a database (relational or NoSQL), with each post containing text, media references, timestamps, etc.
    
Q: How do you generate a personalized feed? Would you use push (fan‑out on write) or pull (fan‑out on read) methods?
A:
    - For fast retrieval, I’d lean towards a push model (fan‑out on write) for most users,
      but for users with millions of followings, a pull model might be more efficient.
    
Q: How are follow relationships stored and utilized in feed generation?
A:
    - Follow relationships are stored in a social graph (as a table or in a graph database) and used to query for recent posts from followed users.
    
Q: How do you handle features like likes, comments, direct messaging, and tagging?
A:
    - Each feature is handled by its own service (e.g., a like service, comment service, messaging service),
      with the core post service integrating these interactions.
    
Q: How would you scale the service to handle billions of users and high read/write volumes?
A:
    - Partition data by user or region, use caching (e.g., Redis), and choose an efficient feed generation model.
    
Q: How do you manage data partitioning and caching for social feeds?
A:
    - Use horizontal sharding for users/posts and cache popular feeds or post objects in an in‑memory store.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. Ride-Sharing Service (Uber/Lyft)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you match a rider's request with the nearest available driver?
A:
    - Use geospatial indexing (e.g., Redis GEO) to quickly query for nearby available drivers.
    
Q: What data structures would you use for efficient geospatial queries?
A:
    - Utilize a geospatial index such as a quadtree, R-tree, or Redis’ built‑in GEO commands.
    
Q: How would you handle millions of real-time location updates from drivers?
A:
    - Use a scalable, in‑memory data store (like Redis) to update and query driver locations efficiently.
    
Q: How do you design the dispatch system to ensure quick response times?
A:
    - Partition dispatch services by geographic regions and use asynchronous messaging to assign rides.
    
Q: How would you partition the system geographically to reduce latency?
A:
    - Deploy servers in multiple regions and route requests based on the rider's location.
    
Q: What strategies would you use to handle network failures and ensure high availability?
A:
    - Implement redundancy (multiple dispatch servers) and use failover mechanisms, along with robust error handling and retry logic.
    
------------------------------------------------------------
10. API Rate Limiter (GitHub API Example)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How would you track the number of requests a client makes within a given time window?
A:
    - Use an in‑memory store (e.g., Redis) with atomic increment operations and keys that expire after the time window.
    
Q: Which algorithms (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket) would you consider, and why?
A:
    - A fixed window is simple, but a sliding window or token bucket offers smoother enforcement, allowing short bursts.
    
Q: How do you ensure that the rate limiting works across a distributed set of servers?
A:
    - Centralize the rate limit counters in a shared store (Redis) or use consistent hashing to route requests for the same client to the same server.
    
Q: What data store would you use for atomic operations and how do you handle key expiration?
A:
    - Use Redis for atomic INCR operations with key expiration.
    
Q: How would you allow for bursts without compromising the average rate limit?
A:
    - Implement a token bucket algorithm that allows temporary bursts but refills tokens at a steady rate.
    
------------------------------------------------------------
11. Notification System (Push Notifications)
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How would you design the system to create and send notifications?
A:
    - Build a Notification Service that creates Notification objects and stores them.
    - Use user preferences to decide the delivery channel.
    
Q: What components would manage user preferences and select the correct delivery channel?
A:
    - The User component stores preferences, and a DeliveryMethod abstraction handles sending via email, SMS, or push.
    
Q: How would you handle high volumes of notifications? Would you use a message queue or event stream?
A:
    - Use an event‑driven architecture with message queues (e.g., Kafka) to decouple notification creation from delivery.
    
Q: How do you batch notifications to reduce load and ensure timely delivery?
A:
    - Implement batching in the delivery service, grouping notifications to be sent together.
    
Q: How do you ensure the system is highly available and can scale to millions of users?
A:
    - Scale the delivery services horizontally, replicate the message queues, and use caching for user preferences.
    
Q: How do you handle throttling and ensure that notifications are delivered securely and reliably?
A:
    - Use throttling mechanisms at the delivery channel level and secure token-based authentication for communication.
